  # About
  `auto-ssl` is an OpenResty container with a LUA plugin called `autossl` added.  It can automatically get TLS certs from Let's Encrypt if there aren't any to satisfy HTTPS requests.  It caches its certs in a `redis` instance.

  It is almost always used as a sidecar container on other services, acting as a reverse proxy.

  ## Source
  `auto-ssl` is a self-built image, version controlled in the [`autossl` repo](https://github.com/msolters/autossl).
